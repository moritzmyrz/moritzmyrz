ðŸ“£ How about a quote before you go?

> I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.

> <p>- Abraham Lincoln</p>
