ðŸ“£ How about a quote before you go?

> Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.

> <p>- Bruce Lee</p>
