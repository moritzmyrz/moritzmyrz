ðŸ“£ How about a quote before you go?

> Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing. There is a time for silence. A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny. And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when it's all over.

> <p>- Octavia E. Butler</p>
