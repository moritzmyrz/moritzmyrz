ðŸ“£ How about a quote before you go?

> Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise. Many men know a great deal and are all the greater fools for it. There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool. But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.
>
> <p>- Charles Spurgeon</p>
